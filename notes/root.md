# Starfinder: The Deep Black

## Prologue

We're exploring a new planet at the edge of current civilization
Mission is sponsored by some company but we're independents that take contracts

Story starts with us on a jump ship and everyone rushing to get onto drop ships
Seemingly because the jump ship crew are jerks that don't care what happens to the passengers and equipment 
In the rush, there's some minor accidents and such that cause more trouble
we cleared it up, which gave us some clout and got us an introduction to administrator Ri-Ez
She's one of the 4 heads of this missions

Most everyone gets to the planet safely... there are exceptions, including one of the two dropships capable of landing and returning to orbit.
So there's ~150 people and gear that just landed
Base camp is in a large area covered in blue grass
There's an AI assistant named Vira
This is basically the only place that probes would function so we assume the the not-blue-areas are dangerous
A little science-ing tells us that the blue grass originated from Ye Olde Earth and contains high levels of silver
This is super strange because supposedly this planet has never been visited before
