## Objectives
1. [X] Collect Grass Samples

## Rewards
1. [ ] Reward

## Summary
[[npc.dr-tyrone-tenon]] wanted us to get some grass samples at the edge the blue. I think we basically opted for 4 side quests which we could do all at once.


## Notes
Alternative mission which we declined: Travel 4(?) weeks to help setup a forward operating base outside the blue
