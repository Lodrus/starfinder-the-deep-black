# Current Situation
* Continuing the fight in the administrator's meeting
* Horatio was murdered by Charleen
* Donovan was killed in the fight when the truck flipped over

---

We cleaned up the remaining bots. There were a couple more bots guarding [[npc.ri-es]]' cell. We promotoed [[npc.yellen]] to Head Administrator, granting her system access enough to shutdown the guard bots and kill power to the entire base.

During the outage, the eastern security fence was breached. We hooked [[npc.vira]] into the local radio comms as we headed to the east gate. She informed us that [[npc.hank]] was shot, seemingly by Dip, who then flew off in the only remaining drop ship. We're pretty sure that Charlene is a shape shifter and is the real perp. Shit.

We arrived at the eastern, breached gate. There are a ton of dead guards and such. Bodies are strewn about. Monsters (Apebears and Shadow Flyers?) are pouring in. We recognize them as some of the critters that were flying in and out of the "giant monster". Roll for initiative.

We made short work of the apebears and shadow flyers. The small building with mounted turrets was filled with more bodies cut in half. We detected a pheremone trail that led to the nearby IT building where the full system reset was running. We followed and found more dead staff inside. We watched the final IT staff member get cut in half by an invisible assailant. Roll for initiative... in the next session.
