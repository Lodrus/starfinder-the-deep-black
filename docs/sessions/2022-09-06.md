# Current Situation

- the base is having all sorts of technical problems
- We met with the board to present our case, address Ri-ez' imprisonment and figure out which of them was actually on our side
- During the meeting, Charlene did some murdering in the board room, 
- we needed to track and shutdown the dropship but that didn't work for unknown reasons and IT basically said "malware"
- so we suggested to Yellen said "factory reset everything"
- However, during that reset, the security fence went offline and was breached
- Having cleared the waves of monsters who were breaching the wall (tokyo drift style) we checked in with the IT guys
- Unable to contact the IT guys, and noticing a pheramone trail towards the IT service desk
- Followed Pheramone trail to the IT service desk

We arrive at the Server farm to find a Scyther 

Scyther identification:
* improved adaptation to this planet (immune to critical attacks, and non-silvered weapons)
* Immune to almost all poisons, disease, fire. 
* Vulnerable to the special poison
* Frightening presence

We began to whittle away at this horrible monster. 
* Todd realized it was alergic to silver and stabbed him with it, it seemed to hurt it a bit more
* It uses fear as a breath weapon
* Hits like a truck!
* Finally, it went down from a swift slash with a silver knife. 

We explore the service desk facility
* Base systems are reset > Defenses are online! 
* Should we plug vira back into the system?
    * Vira copy is reset here; it obviously doesn't remember anything. 
    * Is our Vira the malware? Note that the box Vira is easier to manipulate which is probably why they wanted to steal that one in an earlier mission.
* We run a diff with the factory vira: factory vira suggests that box vira is highly deviant. 
    * Many safety protocols have been turned off (may lead to self-actualization, against many treaties)
    * Large amount of memory storage has been filled.
    * Dip - "Are you alive?" Vira - "Uhm, please don't make me small again"


* We evaluate the potential of installing Vira into the mainframe
    * Is it wise to give a VI control of the base defensese etc.?
    * We eventually decided to do it and keep a box-copy  (therefore again breaking the rule)
* Approx. 1 day until the large monster arrives.

Other updates:
* Hank is okay. 
* IT staff likely peaced out.
* 6000 xp from Scyther > Level 7
* Can recquisition a weapon and an armor from the new level.  
* Scientists can use the pheramones to come up with a way to lead the giant monster away from the base. 
* Next time we will attack the "bad guy" base (40 guys)
    * lost a bunch of stuff when we landed to a splinter group who have both of the drop ships.
