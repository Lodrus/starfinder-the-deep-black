# Current Situation

- the base is having all sorts of technical problems
- We met with the board to present our case, address Ri-ez' imprisonment and figure out which of them was actually on our side
- During the meeting, Charlene did some murdering in the board room, 
- we needed to track and shutdown the dropship but that didn't work for unknown reasons and IT basically said "malware"
- so we suggested to Yellen said "factory reset everything"
- However, during that reset, the security fence went offline and was breached
- Having cleared the waves of monsters who were breaching the wall (tokyo drift style) we checked in with the IT guys
- Unable to contact the IT guys, and noticing a pheramone trail towards the IT service desk
- Followed Pheramone trail to the IT service desk

We arrive at the Server farm to find a Scyther 

Scyther has improved adaptation to this planet.
