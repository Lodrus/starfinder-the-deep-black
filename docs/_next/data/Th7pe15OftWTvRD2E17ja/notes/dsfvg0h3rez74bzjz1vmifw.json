She's the Oversight Director for Pact Worlds. Basically, she's here to make sure that laws are followed.</p>\n<p>We head back to that strange tunnel with some appropriate gear to clear it.\nIt's not natural! We were expecting a ship but it's actually a lab of some kind.\nIt has some computer terminals, tube, cables, etc, and a bunch of large, empty tanks.\nOnly one tank has contents: A silvery liquid and there's not much left.\nWe don't know what it's for but guess that the remaining liquid represents dozens of years' worth.\nThe tunnels go deeper but before we can check it outâ€¦</p>\n<p>Our comm beacon hack watcher thing (mission 1) sends us an email!\nThe hacked comm beacon sits between the main base and the local FOB\nIt's telling Vira that we're not in this lab. Our positional data says that we're in the FOB.\nApparently, somebody wanted us to appear to be at the FOB when we're actually in those tunnels\nSo we decide to head back to the FOB and see whatever we aren't supposed to</p>\n<p>Everything cranks up to 11\nThe FOB is under attack. There's a pair of badasses at the cargo elevator. We talk them into letting us up into the tree houses. They basically say \"Sure! Leave no witnesses\"\nThere's a dozen or so scientists holed up. Hank and Zee-Ann Dreek are double-handedly(?) holding off a the assault.\nTurns out hank is one scary mofo.\nWe weren't meant to save both Hank and Zee-Ann. But we did! Because we're also scary!\nThe baddies tried to steal Vira but we barely recovered her.</p>\n<p>Within moments, an earthquake starts.\nAnd the land near the tunnel/lab starts bulging.\nAnd out comes monster. A seriously large monster.\nOne thousand feet tall, in a turtle-esque shell with many holes in it.\nThere are loads of other, typically sized creatures as well. We've not seen these yet.\nThose smaller critters are entering and exiting the shell. Like tunnels.\nThe giant monster is heading back towards main base.\nNot a clue why or what it's doing.</p>\n<p>The missing dropship arrives!\nIt scoops up those 2 badasses guarding below.\nAnd then shoots up our trucks and equipment for the FOB. Comms are down.\nWe frankenstein 2 trucks and some crappy comms.\nThen head to main base over the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>At main base, we discover that while things are calm, it's not right here.\nComms are down.\nVita is offline.\n<a href=\"/notes/svr5zldsc8orgtu7kq59dhm\">Administrator Ri-Es</a> was arrested for the murder of <a href=\"/notes/3hg6cni2sx3c920td0kzxf3\">Administrator Robinson</a>\nGiant monster is about 2 days away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#notes\"></a>Notes</h2>\n<p>Who hired us to escort Zee-Ann??</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/1i5tez24goa0w49rregw8h0\">Dr Tyrone Tenon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/svr5zldsc8orgtu7kq59dhm\">Administrator Ri-Es</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"1hg4ddaxuksk7moer4url4n","title":"starfinder-the-deep-black","desc":"","updated":1659843859229,"created":1659273737992,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"starfinder-the-deep-black"},"contentHash":"acdaf50a2e0a2a0074c9c6945b3a4f27","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"1hg4ddaxuksk7moer4url4n","vaultName":"starfinder-the-deep-black"},"value":"npc.ri-es","alias":"npc.ri-es","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":74,"offset":545},"end":{"line":10,"column":87,"offset":558},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"npc.ri-es"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"1hg4ddaxuksk7moer4url4n","vaultName":"starfinder-the-deep-black"},"value":"npc.robinson","alias":"npc.robinson","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":32,"offset":734},"end":{"line":13,"column":48,"offset":750},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"npc.robinson"}}],"anchors":{"starfinder-the-deep-black":{"type":"header","text":"Starfinder: The Deep Black","value":"starfinder-the-deep-black","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"prologue":{"type":"header","text":"Prologue","value":"prologue","line":9,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["cwd37czrvr9uh5i5rtiz85o","z7zbjcmjwdrwk9zh3be6rkl","ui3100g15lg8mslx8jatd2z","nqtzxqhl4thg7n0jk9iu8vm","iixm372kfaciz7n18t9r377"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Starfinder: The Deep Black\n\n## Prologue\n\nWe're exploring a new planet at the edge of current civilization.
