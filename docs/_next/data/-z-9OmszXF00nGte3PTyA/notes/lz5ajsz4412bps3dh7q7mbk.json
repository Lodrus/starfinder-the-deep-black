Monsters (Apebears and Shadow Flyers?) are pouring in. We recognize them as some of the critters that were flying in and out of the \"giant monster\". Roll for initiative.</p>\n<p>We made short work of the apebears and shadow flyers. The small building with mounted turrets was filled with more bodies cut in half. We detected a pheremone trail that led to the nearby IT building where the full system reset was running. We followed and found more dead staff inside. We watched the final IT staff member get cut in half by an invisible assailant. Roll for initiative... in the next session.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/9a04t1u7zmwoz4firvg5t6p\">Hank</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/0q088gzuqhwbltr2yn98x0u\">Administrator Yellen</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"1hg4ddaxuksk7moer4url4n","title":"starfinder-the-deep-black","desc":"","updated":1659843859229,"created":1659273737992,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"starfinder-the-deep-black"},"contentHash":"acdaf50a2e0a2a0074c9c6945b3a4f27","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"1hg4ddaxuksk7moer4url4n","vaultName":"starfinder-the-deep-black"},"value":"npc.ri-es","alias":"npc.ri-es","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":74,"offset":545},"end":{"line":10,"column":87,"offset":558},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"npc.ri-es"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"1hg4ddaxuksk7moer4url4n","vaultName":"starfinder-the-deep-black"},"value":"npc.robinson","alias":"npc.robinson","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":32,"offset":734},"end":{"line":13,"column":48,"offset":750},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"npc.robinson"}}],"anchors":{"starfinder-the-deep-black":{"type":"header","text":"Starfinder: The Deep Black","value":"starfinder-the-deep-black","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"prologue":{"type":"header","text":"Prologue","value":"prologue","line":9,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["cwd37czrvr9uh5i5rtiz85o","z7zbjcmjwdrwk9zh3be6rkl","ui3100g15lg8mslx8jatd2z","nqtzxqhl4thg7n0jk9iu8vm","iixm372kfaciz7n18t9r377"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Starfinder: The Deep Black\n\n## Prologue\n\nWe're exploring a new planet at the edge of current civilization.
