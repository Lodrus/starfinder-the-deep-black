## Objectives

1. [x] Collect Grass Samples

## Rewards

1. [ ] Reward

## Summary

[Dr Tenon](../npcs/tyrone-tenon.md) wanted us to get some grass samples at the edge the blue. I think we basically opted for 4 side quests which we could do all at once.

## Notes

Alternative mission which we declined: Travel 4(?) weeks to help setup a forward operating base outside the blue
