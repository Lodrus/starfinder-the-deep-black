<h2 id="summary"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>We travel from main base with Dr Zee-ann Dreek, a Female Kobold Aasimar, and deliver her to the FOB. She's the Oversight Director for Pact Worlds. Basically, she's here to make sure that laws are followed.</p>
<p>We head back to that strange tunnel with some appropriate gear to clear it.
It's not natural! We were expecting a ship but it's actually a lab of some kind.
It has some computer terminals, tube, cables, etc, and a bunch of large, empty tanks.
Only one tank has contents: A silvery liquid and there's not much left.
We don't know what it's for but guess that the remaining liquid represents dozens of years' worth.
The tunnels go deeper but before we can check it out…</p>
<p>Our comm beacon hack watcher thing (mission 1) sends us an email!
The hacked comm beacon sits between the main base and the local FOB
It's telling Vira that we're not in this lab. Our positional data says that we're in the FOB.
Apparently, somebody wanted us to appear to be at the FOB when we're actually in those tunnels
So we decide to head back to the FOB and see whatever we aren't supposed to</p>
<p>Everything cranks up to 11
The FOB is under attack. There's a pair of badasses at the cargo elevator. We talk them into letting us up into the tree houses. They basically say "Sure! Leave no witnesses"
There's a dozen or so scientists holed up. Hank and Zee-Ann Dreek are double-handedly(?) holding off a the assault.
Turns out hank is one scary mofo.
We weren't meant to save both Hank and Zee-Ann. But we did! Because we're also scary!
The baddies tried to steal Vira but we barely recovered her.</p>
<p>Within moments, an earthquake starts.
And the land near the tunnel/lab starts bulging.
And out comes monster. A seriously large monster.
One thousand feet tall, in a turtle-esque shell with many holes in it.
There are loads of other, typically sized creatures as well. We've not seen these yet.
Those smaller critters are entering and exiting the shell. Like tunnels.
The giant monster is heading back towards main base.
Not a clue why or what it's doing.</p>
<p>The missing dropship arrives!
It scoops up those 2 badasses guarding below.
And then shoots up our trucks and equipment for the FOB. Comms are down.
We frankenstein 2 trucks and some crappy comms.
Then head to main base over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>At main base, we discover that while things are calm, it's not right here.
Comms are down.
Vita is offline.
