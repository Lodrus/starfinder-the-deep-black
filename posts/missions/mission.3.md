## Objectives

1. [x] Help setup another Forward Operating Base (FOB)
2. [x] Scout an area with seemingly interesting geographic features

## Rewards

1. [ ] Reward

## Summary

We travel a few days in trucks and drop off people/equipment for the FOB.
Hank is our driver. He's cool.

We head out for the secondary mission nearby and discover some Fox Squirrels. They're sentient! We name one Buttons and he travels with us for a bit. A couple hours more travel and we arrive at the "interesting geography" shown in the satellite images. It's basically the Mana Tree. The lowest branches are ~200 feet off the ground and span a couple kilometers of ground. The trunk was ~600 feet across. Two big discoveries

1. There's a large ring of black stone nearby. Looks scary as hell and Buttons won't approach. There's a caved in tunnel inside the ring. We need to return with tools to explore it.
2. There are actual wood buildings overhead built on top of the lowest branches. They're old and dilapidated! Again, this planet is supposedly unvisited. That's clearly wrong now.

At some point, the FOB moves to this tree and occupies these tree houses. All goals accomplished so we head back home and plan to return with proper gear. Buttons leaves the party.
