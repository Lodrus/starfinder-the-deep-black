Ri-Es is o. Her left arm is a robotic replacement.

## Connection

In the chaos of the expedition launch, we saved an injured Ysoki. This garnered clout for us among the Ysoki personel. News spread fast and she allowed us into her drop pod, inadvertantly saving our lives as our originally allocated drop pod had crash landed.

Without any real knowledge of expedition's people or politics, we defaulted to trusting Ri-Es with sensitive discoveries and concerns.

## Motivations and Fears

Seemingly just wants things to run smoothly and safely. She is easily distressed by talks of sabotage or foul play. Clearly, not a fan of [[npc.robinson]] though we aren't entirely sure why.

## Major Events

While we were traveling for [[mission 4|mission.4]], Ri-Es seemingly murdered [[npc.robinson]]. A security camera recorded Ri-Es strangling him with her robotic arm. She was placed under arrest. Suspiciously, nobody was permitted to inspect her robotic arm. This was to be done off world, effectively removing her from the expedition permanently.
